---

A rails integration for [pingback-ruby](https://github.com/democracy-news/pingback-ruby)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'act_as_pingback', github: 'democracy-news/act_as_pingback'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install act_as_pingback

## Usage
You need to create a free account [here](#) before using this gem.
```ruby
Pingback.configure do |config|
  config.api_token = ENV['PINGBACK_TOKEN']
end
```

Install `act_as_pingback` in the models you want and enable which fields you want to include in the pingback:

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  act_as_pingback fields: [
                    :title,
                    :body,
                    :url
                  ]
end
```

This would send a request to `pingback.democracy.news` with:

```ruby
{
  title: "Hello world",
  body: "<p>I created this using a tutorial from https://google.com and <a href=\"https://code.tutsplus.com/\">envato</a></p>",
  url: "https://myblog.com/posts/hello-world"
}
```

on `post#create` and `post#update` `post#delete` by default.

`url` by default will be `Rails.application.routes.url_helpers.url(self)`. To override this:
```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  act_as_pingback fields: [
                    :formatted_title,
                    :body,
                    :url
                  ],
                  callbacks: false,
                  on: [
                    :create
                  ],
                  async: true,
                  queue: 'cms'

    def url
      "https://myotherblog.com/posts/#{slug}"
    end

    def formatted_title
      "[POST] #{title}"
    end
end
```

Becomes:

```ruby
{
  title: "[POST] Hello world",
  body: "<p>I created this using a tutorial from https://google.com and <a href=\"https://code.tutsplus.com/\">envato</a></p>",
  url: "https://myotherblog.com/posts/hello-world"
}
```

### Options
Argument | Type | Default | Description
--|--|--|--
`fields` | `Array` (symbols) | `[]` | A list of the fields to include in the request. These would be any with links to process.
`callbacks` | `Boolean` | `true` | Trigger on active record callbacks? _(Only enabled for `ActiveRecord` objects)_
`on` | `Array` | `:create, :update, :delete` | Which lifecycle events should this library fire for
`async` | `Boolean` | `false` | Should this be run in the background?
`queue` | `String` | `default` | The queue name for this to run in _(Only supports `Sidekiq` right now)_

```ruby
# example
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  act_as_pingback fields: [
                    :title,
                    :body,
                    :url
                  ],
                  callbacks: false,
                  on: [
                    :create
                  ],
                  async: true,
                  queue: 'cms'

end
```
